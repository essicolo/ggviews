The trajectory outlines the creation of a Python data visualization library, , from scratch. The initial user request was to build a -style API for the For help with the holoviews command run:

holoviews --help library, emphasizing a method-chaining syntax.

The process began with a misunderstanding of the project type; the AI initially assumed a full-stack web application. After user clarification, the AI pivoted to creating a standalone Python package. The development was highly iterative and driven by user feedback. The AI first scaffolded the basic package structure ( directory with modules for , , , , ).

Development progressed by implementing core  features incrementally. The user provided two complex  code examples, which served as concrete development goals. To match these examples, the AI had to implement specific features on demand, including , , advanced  color scales, and support for free scales in faceting.

The final phase involved adding more advanced features like statistical transformations, position adjustments, and additional geoms to move closer to 100%  compatibility. The last interaction involved the AI fixing a broken example Jupyter notebook that had become outdated due to API changes during development, demonstrating a response to direct user-reported bugs.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a Python library named  that acts as a wrapper for the For help with the holoviews command run:

holoviews --help library, providing an API that mimics the popular R library .

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **ggplot-style API:** The primary interface should be a  class that allows for the creation of plots by adding layers.
2.  **Method Chaining:** The API must support a fluent, method-chaining syntax (e.g., ).
3.  **Grammar of Graphics Components:** Implement key components of the Grammar of Graphics:
    *   **Geoms:** Create functions for common geometries (, , , , , etc.).
    *   **Aesthetics ():** A function to map data variables to visual properties like , , , and .
    *   **Scales:** Control color gradients and axes (, ).
    *   **Faceting:** Implement  and  for creating subplots, including support for free scales.
    *   **Themes:** Provide pre-built themes (, ) and a path for custom theme control.
    *   **Coordinates:** Implement coordinate systems like  and .
4.  **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for future extensions.
5.  **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** The library is intended for use in environments like Jupyter notebooks.

The development process has been guided by specific user examples, aiming to achieve functional parity with provided  plots.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Grammar of Graphics:** The underlying principle of building plots layer by layer (data, aesthetics, geometries, scales, facets).
- **Method Chaining (Fluent API):** A programming style where multiple method calls are chained together, improving code readability.
- **Holoviews:** The backend Python library used for rendering the interactive plots.
- **Python Package Development:** Creation of a structured, installable Python library with distinct modules for different functionalities.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a standalone Python library with associated examples and tests. The backend/frontend directories from the initial boilerplate are unused.

**Directory Structure:**


**File Summaries:**
- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the heart of the library, containing the main  class. It manages the plot state, layers, and the method-chaining logic.
  - **Changes:** This file was created and repeatedly modified to integrate new components like geoms, scales, facets, and coordinate systems into the  object.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file defines the public API of the  package, making key classes and functions (, , geoms, etc.) directly importable from the library.
  - **Changes:** It was created and updated every time a new feature (e.g., , ) was added to expose it to the user.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files define the geometric objects (geoms) that draw the data, such as points, lines, and bars. This is how data is visually represented.
  - **Changes:** Created with initial geoms, and  was added later to implement more advanced geoms.  was added to  based on a user request.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Implements  and , which are critical for creating multi-plot figures based on data subsets. This was a key user requirement.
  - **Changes:** Created and later enhanced to support free scales () to match a user-provided example.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Implements coordinate systems, specifically  and , which control the aspect ratio of the plot panels.
  - **Changes:** This file was created in response to a direct user request to implement .

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main demonstration notebook showing how to use the library's features.
  - **Changes:** Initially created, it fell out of sync with the API. The most recent action was to completely rewrite this file with up-to-date, working examples to fix user-reported errors.

<pending_tasks>
- **Achieve 100%  Coverage:** Continue implementing features outlined in . This includes:
  - More geoms and statistical transformations.
  - Fine-grained theme control (e.g., ).
  - Additional coordinate systems and advanced scales.
- **Create Troubleshooting Guide:** As mentioned in the last step, a simple guide for users is pending.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to fix the main demonstration notebook, . The user reported that most cells were returning errors, likely because the notebook had not been updated as the library's API evolved.

To address this, the AI engineer first created a temporary Python script () to verify that the core components of the  library were importable and functional. The test script confirmed that the library itself was working as expected.

With this confirmation, the engineer proceeded to rewrite the content of . The notebook was updated with corrected import statements and modernized API calls to ensure that all demonstration cells execute correctly and showcase the library's current capabilities without errors. This action directly resolved the user's bug report. The final message from the AI indicated an intent to create a troubleshooting guide next.
